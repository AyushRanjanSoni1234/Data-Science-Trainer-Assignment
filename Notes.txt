We have two datasets in the form of two inputs. In the first input data, there are four columns such as S.No, Name, Team Name and User Id.
In the second input data, there are five columns such as S.No, Name, User Id, Total statements and Total reasons.
So, we have to perform two tasks as output.
The first task is to get the rank of each team on the basis of the sum of the average of statements and reasons.
The second task is to get the rank of every individual people on the basis of a total number of statements and reasons.
